# World-Weather

A web application to find the local weather forecast using Weatherstack API.

## Built With

This project has been built with:

* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - To gain access to [Ajax](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/)
* [React.js](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) - Framwork used

## Getting Started

To get started, follow the steps below.

### Installation

You will need to install the libraries/frameworks below:

JQuery (mostly for Ajax in this project):

```
npm install jquery
```

React:

```
npm install react 
```

React-DOM (to render):

```
npm install react-dom
```

Babel standalone:

```
npm install @babel/standalone
```

Font Awesome (for icons):

```
npm install font-awesome
```

A live-server is also necessary. As it says in https://github.com/tapio/live-server, AJAX requests don't work with the ```file://``` protocol due to security restrictions. Therefore, a [server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) is needed. 

```
npm install live-server
```

### Run

To run the app, follow the steps below:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the folder called ```World-Weather```
2. Type ```live-server``` and click enter
3. Done
